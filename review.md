Paper Title: PUMP: Architectural Support for Software-Defined Metadata Processing

## Summary
This paper introduces a new hardware framework for tagging memory and enforcing security polices 
based on those tags. It runs on RISC CPUs and tag each word(64B) with a pointer sized tag(64B).
With the tags set, the security policy programmer could write polices to be evaluated on each instruction. 
They also optimized it with opgroups, tag compres- sion, tag translation, and miss handler acceleration.

### Problem and why we care
As the attack on system/software keep evolving, new kind of attack come out every day. We want to create
a framework for security operators to write security polices so that they can prevent the attacks.
We want to efficiently support fine-grained, software-defined metadata propagation without placing a visible, 
hard bound on the number of bits allocated to metadata or a bound on the number of policies simultaneously enforced

### Gap in current approaches
Currently, it's hard to implement security polices without a high overhead. Although we can use software to
define a security polices, the overhead is too high. Intel proposed hardware for bounds checking and isolation,
but they can only prevent a limited set of attacks.


### Hypothesis, Key Idea, or Main Claim
Associates a metadata tag with every word in the system’s main memory, caches, and registers. And enforce polices
based on those tags. Create rule cache to cache the result of a policy on certain tag patterns.

### Method for Proving the Claim 
Proposed four typical security polices and implemented them with the PUMP framework.

### Method for evaluating


### Contributions: what we take away


## Pros (3-6 bullets)
- Universal framework that could be used to implement all kinds of security polices.
- Fast -- with hardware caches, most instructions could be done in single CPU cycle 
-  
## Cons (3-6 bullets)
- Trade off security with performance and memory - do we really need that?
- For security experts: is it necessary to implement all these security features with the framework? 
- Requires the security experts to thoroughly understand the software they are trying to protect and write 
policy for them.
